# Literature Review: Contract Staffing Diffusion in U.S. Nursing Homes

## Theoretical Framework: Spatial Diffusion Theory
The conceptual foundation for this study is rooted in **Spatial Diffusion Theory**, originally articulated by Torsten Hägerstrand (1967). Spatial diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation, practice, or phenomenon spreads across space and time through a social system. In the context of healthcare staffing, contract (agency) labor can be viewed as an organizational practice that propagates through "neighborhood effects"—where the adoption of a practice by one facility increases the likelihood of adoption by neighboring facilities.

This diffusion is driven by three primary mechanisms: (1) **Relocation diffusion**, where staffing agencies expand their footprint into new geographic markets; (2) **Expansion diffusion**, where existing labor practices spread from high-density clusters to surrounding areas; and (3) **Contagion effects**, where labor market competition forces neighboring facilities to react to localized shortages by turning to the same agency pools. Spencer et al. (2023) and Park (2017) demonstrate that diffusion of innovation theory is increasingly relevant for understanding the spread of healthcare delivery models and staffing strategies, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Synthesis by Theme

### Theme 1: Spatial Diffusion and Geographic Clustering of Healthcare Practices
Recent research has increasingly applied spatial epidemiology and spatial autocorrelation techniques to nursing home outcomes. Grady et al. (2024) documented the geographic diffusion of COVID-19 cases in nursing homes, showing how epicenters in the Northeast and Midwest shifted to the South over time, driven by regional risk factors and staff-mediated transmission. Similarly, Rataj et al. (2024) identified significant regional variation in medication use among nursing home residents, suggesting that "practice patterns" are highly localized and subject to geographic clustering rather than solely based on resident acuity.

Lu and Wedig (2011) explicitly examined "clustering" in the context of nursing home chains, finding that geographic proximity influences operating efficiency and agency costs. These studies suggest that nursing homes do not operate in isolation; rather, they are embedded in local networks where practices—including the use of contract labor—are likely to cluster due to shared labor pools and competitive pressures (Li et al., 2022; Nicodemo et al., 2020).

### Theme 2: Nursing Home Workforce Dynamics and the Rise of Agency Staffing
The U.S. nursing home industry has seen a dramatic shift in its workforce composition. Bowblis et al. (2024) report that while only 23% of nursing homes used agency staff in 2018, nearly 50% did so by 2022, with agency hours accounting for 11% of all direct care hours. This "contract-dependent" model is often a response to chronic staffing shortages and high turnover rates among permanent staff (Werner & Coe, 2021). 

Pradhan et al. (2025) found a longitudinal association between high agency staff utilization and increased turnover of permanent RNs and CNAs, suggesting a "vicious cycle" where agency use destabilizes the existing workforce, further increasing the need for more contract labor. This dynamic is central to the "contagion" hypothesis: as one facility loses staff to agencies, nearby facilities may experience similar losses or be forced to match higher agency-driven wages, leading to a geographic spread of contract dependency (Bowblis & Brunt, 2023).

### Theme 3: Labor Market Competition and Regulatory Context
Labor market competition is a critical driver of staffing levels and quality. Zinn (1994) and Hackmann (2017) established that nursing homes in more competitive markets are often forced to increase staffing quality to attract residents, though this is constrained by Medicaid reimbursement rates. Matsudaira (2010) identifies the "monopsony" power of nursing homes in low-wage labor markets, where facilities may artificially suppress wages unless mandated by regulation.

However, the introduction of minimum staffing standards (Bowblis, 2022) can create unintended consequences. If a local labor market has a fixed supply of permanent nurses, facilities may resort to competing for the same limited pool of agency workers, leading to the geographic clusters of high-cost labor identified in recent studies (Gandhi et al., 2020). The high cost of agency labor—often 50-60% higher than permanent staff (Bowblis et al., 2024)—further strains the financial viability of facilities in competitive clusters (Ghiasi et al., 2023; Lord et al., 2023).

### Theme 4: Methodological Approaches to Spatial Analysis
The literature has evolved from simple cross-sectional comparisons to complex longitudinal and spatial models. Pradhan et al. (2024) used multivariable ordinal logistic regression with two-way fixed effects to link agency use to Five-Star ratings. Others, like Li et al. (2022) and Grady et al. (2024), utilize spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) and spatial smoothing to identify significant clusters and diffusion patterns. This study builds on these methods by specifically testing for the *spatial diffusion* of contract staffing over time, moving beyond static clustering to a dynamic model of geographic spread.

## Research Gaps and Opportunities
While the literature has established that agency staffing is increasing and negatively impacts quality (Pradhan et al., 2024; Khoja et al., 2026), there is a significant gap in understanding the **spatial-temporal diffusion** of this trend. Existing studies treat agency use as an independent facility-level decision or a static regional factor. This study addresses this gap by investigating whether contract staffing dependency "spreads" from facility to facility through spatial networks, creating expanding clusters of high-cost, high-turnover labor environments.

## Summary
The current body of knowledge highlights a growing reliance on contract labor in U.S. nursing homes, driven by workforce shortages and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the negative impacts on quality and financial performance are well-documented, the geographic nature of this shift remains under-explored. By applying Spatial Diffusion Theory and advanced spatial analysis, this research aims to determine if contract staffing dependency is a contagious phenomenon that propagates through localized labor markets, providing critical insights for policy interventions aimed at workforce stabilization.
