# Synthesis of Findings: Contract Staffing Diffusion in U.S. Nursing Homes

## Introduction
This synthesis integrates the empirical findings from the spatial analysis of Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) data (2022–2024) with the theoretical framework of Spatial Diffusion Theory and existing literature on nursing home workforce dynamics.

## 1. Theoretical Reconciliation: Spatial Diffusion and Intensification
The analysis reveals a compelling paradox: while the overall **Mean Contract Staffing Ratio** decreased across all census regions between 2022Q1 and 2024Q4, the **Global Moran’s I**—a measure of spatial autocorrelation—nearly doubled from **0.0501** to **0.1068**.

In the context of **Spatial Diffusion Theory** (Hägerstrand, 1967), this indicates a shift from *expansion diffusion* (broad spread across many markets) to *intensification* within specific geographic clusters. As the acute staffing pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic subsided, many facilities reduced their reliance on agency labor. However, in specific "hotspot" regions, the practice has become more deeply embedded. This supports the "neighborhood effect" where labor practices are reinforced by local market conditions and shared agency pools. The findings suggest that contract staffing is no longer a nationwide emergency measure but has transformed into a structural feature of specific regional labor markets.

## 2. Connection to Research Hypotheses

### H1: Spatial Clustering (Supported)
The significant positive Moran’s I in both periods confirms that contract staffing is not randomly distributed. Facilities with high reliance on contract labor are geographically clustered, likely due to shared regional labor shortages and the presence of localized staffing agency networks. The 2024 map (Figure 4) clearly illustrates these clusters, particularly in the Northeast corridor.

### H2: Temporal Expansion and Diffusion (Supported with Nuance)
While the geographic extent (mean usage) contracted, the *strength* of the spatial pattern intensified. This suggests that while fewer facilities overall are using contract staff, those that do are increasingly likely to be surrounded by other high-user facilities. The change map (Figure 5) identifies specific states like Vermont and North Dakota where intensity increased despite the national cooling trend. The diffusion has shifted from a "rising tide" to a "concentrated pooling" effect.

### H3: Proximity and Contagion (Strongly Supported)
The **Proximity Regression** results show that a facility’s contract staffing ratio is strongly predicted by the usage of its neighbors (Coeff: **0.3963**, p < 0.001). This provides empirical evidence for the **Contagion Effect**: as one facility in a county adopts high agency usage, it likely triggers similar adoption in neighboring facilities through labor market competition or by making a local agency branch commercially viable.

### H5: Regional Heterogeneity (Partially Supported)
The analysis shows significant regional variation, but contrary to the initial hypothesis that the South would see higher diffusion, the **Northeast** (0.102) and **Midwest** (0.062) maintained the highest mean ratios in 2024Q4. The South saw the most dramatic decrease (0.097 to 0.040). This suggests that state-level policy environments in the Northeast and Midwest (such as stricter staffing mandates or different reimbursement structures) may be sustaining higher agency reliance compared to the South.

## 3. Expansion of Prior Literature
These findings extend the work of **Bowblis et al. (2024)**, who documented the rapid rise of agency staffing through 2022. Our study identifies the "post-peak" trajectory of this trend. While Bowblis et al. highlighted the nationwide surge, our results show that the "cooling" of the market has not been uniform. 

The identification of rural hotspot states like **Vermont (0.235)**, **North Dakota (0.155)**, and **Montana (0.137)** adds a new dimension to the literature. This suggests that the "vicious cycle" of agency dependency described by **Pradhan et al. (2025)** is particularly acute in rural markets where the lack of permanent labor pools makes facilities more vulnerable to "agency capture"—a state where the local labor supply is almost entirely mediated by third-party contractors.

## 4. Policy Implications: Targeting Clusters
The strong spatial autocorrelation and proximity effects suggest that policy interventions targeting individual facilities may be insufficient. 
- **Regional Workforce Stabilization:** Regulators should consider "cluster-based" interventions. If contract staffing is a regional phenomenon driven by "contagion," then stabilizing a single facility without addressing the neighboring competitors may lead to "staffing leakage."
- **Rural Labor Support:** The high ratios in rural states (VT, ND, MT) indicate that distance-based reimbursement or rural-specific workforce pipelines are needed to break the dependency on high-cost contract labor.
- **Transparency in Agency Pricing:** Given the clustering effect, state-level caps on agency margins (as seen in some Midwest states) may be more effective if coordinated regionally to prevent agencies from simply relocating to a neighboring "uncapped" cluster.

## Key Takeaways for Discussion
1. **From Crisis to Structure:** Contract staffing has evolved from a nationwide pandemic-era necessity into a structural feature of specific regional clusters.
2. **The Power of Proximity:** A facility’s staffing strategy is heavily influenced by its immediate geographic neighbors, suggesting a "contagion" of labor practices.
3. **Rural Vulnerability:** The highest concentrations of contract labor are now found in rural, high-need states, highlighting a geographic disparity in workforce stability.
4. **Spatial Policy Mandate:** Workforce policies must transition from facility-level oversight to regional market-based strategies to effectively address the spatial diffusion of contract labor.
