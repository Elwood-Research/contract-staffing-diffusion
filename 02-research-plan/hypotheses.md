# Research Hypotheses

## H1: Spatial Clustering (The "Hotspot" Hypothesis)
Contract staffing ratios are not randomly distributed across the United States; instead, they exhibit significant positive spatial autocorrelation, with facilities having high ratios being geographically clustered near other high-ratio facilities.

## H2: Temporal Expansion (The "Diffusion" Hypothesis)
The geographic extent of contract staffing "hotspots" has significantly expanded between 2022 and 2024, moving from urban centers into suburban and rural areas.

## H3: The Proximity Hypothesis (The "Contagion" Effect)
The probability of a facility increasing its contract staffing ratio is positively associated with the contract staffing intensity of neighboring facilities (within a 25-mile radius), controlling for facility characteristics.

## H4: Ownership Vulnerability
For-profit facilities and those belonging to large chains will exhibit faster diffusion of contract staffing compared to non-profit or independent facilities, potentially acting as "bridge" facilities for regional expansion.

## H5: Regional Heterogeneity
The rate of diffusion and the strength of spatial autocorrelation will be significantly higher in the South and Midwest regions compared to the Northeast and West, reflecting differences in state-level staffing mandates and labor market tightness.
