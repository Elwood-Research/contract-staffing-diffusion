# Study: Contract Staffing Diffusion in U.S. Nursing Homes

## Research Question
How has the use of contract nursing staff diffused across United States nursing homes between 2022 and 2024, and to what extent does geographic proximity to high-contract facilities influence a facility's adoption of contract staffing?

## Background
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing homes have increasingly turned to staffing agencies to fill vacancies. While contract staffing provides flexibility, it is often more expensive and has been linked to variations in care quality. Understanding whether this trend is spreading geographically (diffusion) can help policymakers address regional workforce shortages.

## Objectives
1. Measure spatial autocorrelation of contract staffing ratios at the county and facility levels (2022-2024).
2. Identify "contract contagion hotspots" (clusters of high-contract facilities) and track their geographic expansion over time.
3. Test the proximity hypothesis: Does geographic distance to high-contract facilities predict future increases in a facility's own contract staffing ratio?
4. Compare spatial diffusion patterns across the four U.S. Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West).

## Scope
- **Time period**: CY2022Q1 to CY2024Q4 (12 quarters).
- **Population**: Medicare-certified nursing homes in the contiguous United States.
- **Key variables**: Contract and employee hours for RNs, LPNs, and CNAs; Facility location (County FIPS, State).

## Expected Outcomes
- Documentation of "hotspots" where contract staffing is particularly prevalent.
- Evidence of whether contract staffing "spreads" from facility to facility based on proximity.
- Regional maps showing the evolution of staffing agency reliance.
